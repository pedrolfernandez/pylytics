Autogenerate the requirements.txt, after that PyCharm takes care of managing new dependencies

$ pip install pipreqs
$ pipreqs /home/project/location
Successfully saved requirements file in /home/project/location/requirements.txt


First docker tests:

docker run -i -t --rm python:3.6.2

(rm -> container will be removed after quitting the session)

docker build my image:
C:\Users\plfernandez\PycharmProjects\pylytics (master)
λ docker build -t plfernandez/pylytics .

docker run my image:
C:\Users\plfernandez\PycharmProjects\pylytics (master)
λ docker run -p 5000:5000 plfernandez/pylytics

On windows I need to run Xming server to get a GUI and see the graphs
docker run -e DISPLAY=10.0.75.1:0 -p 5000:5000 plfernandez/pylytics
(IP can be checked in the xming service log)
